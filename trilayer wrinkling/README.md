The code here simulates the growth of biofilm grown on agar substrate.

The configuration was experimentally identified to contain three layers: biofilm, debris (left by cells, consisting of mainly
matrix) and the agar substrate. Expanding biofilms (and the debris) are attached to and are constrained by the agar substrate.


To account for the growth induced compression, which triggers mechanical instabilty and surface undulations, we treated the 
biofilm as an thin elastic sheet, growing but restricted to a certain area by "walls".
