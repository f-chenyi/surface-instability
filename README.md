# surface-instability
When thin elastic films are adhered to elastic substrate, different buckling modes can be observed when under compression. This phenomenon has been the subject of many recent modeling efforts due to its importance in soft electronics, tissue mechanics, and materials failure. 

The surface instability patterns can be classified into creases, wrinkles, folds, period-doubles, ridges and delaminated blisters according to their distinctive topographical characteristics (Wang et al. Sci. Rep. 2015). 

The same mechanism is believed to control a variety of fascinating morphological patterns arise on surfaces of growing, developing tissues, organs and microorganism colonies. The key elements in these developmental systems are: two or more biomaterial layers undergoing differential growth. The growth induced strain mismatch drives the morphogenesis process.

Here, we developed a planar strain model to simulate the morphoelastic problem using finite element methods. The nonlinear minization problem (of elastic energy) is implemented in the open-source platforn FEniCS (see https://fenicsproject.org).
